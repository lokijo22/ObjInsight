==========

ObjInsight is an in-progress to-be Python module designed to facilitate quick analysis, deep investigation,
and understanding of Python objects for both beginners and experienced programmers.

## IMPORTANT - DISCLAIMER
Due to the recentness of the projects creation and my newness to programming,
**current functionality is very limited and rough**.
_**THIS WILL IMPROVE**_ but will require time and work.

## Features

#### Implemented
- A simple printout with basic information about a given python object (as specified in the file itself)
- listing of methods stored in the object and a description of each (as provided by the authors of given methods)
- listing of variables stored in a given object as well as their types

#### Planned
- improved formating for improved printout display readability
- Various options and configurations to customize output and isolate desired information
- implementation into a module
- allow for users to input arguments from the command line
