ObjInsight
==========

### By Lokiel Reed

This project is meant to provide an easy to use, flexible and
in depth view of python objects. It currently allows for the user
to view an object's variables and methods as well as giving a brief
description of each(as provided by their developer).



## Installation

Click the download source button

### Option 2

## IMPORTANT - First Release
Due to the recentness of the projects creation and my newness to programming, current functionality
is very limited and requires for a user to edit the python file to make it process the desired object.



## Contributions
Contributions welcome! If you have ideas or find bugs, please open an issue or submit a pull request. I
am new to using git, GitHub and am still learning python. **any and all support or advice is very welcome**!



## Moving Forward

I also Intend to use and update a vision board, both will be announced here when available.
